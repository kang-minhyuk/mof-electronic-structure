# HSE06 Band Edges for QMOF Structures  
### Zenodo Record: 10.5281/zenodo.15078750

## 1. Overview

This metadata entry documents the **HSE06 band-edge dataset for QMOF structures** published on Zenodo:

**Link:** https://zenodo.org/records/15078750  
**Primary file:** `qmof_hse_band_edges.csv`  
**License:** CC BY 4.0

The dataset provides **hybrid-functional (HSE06)** conduction band minima (CBM), valence band maxima (VBM), and band gaps for a subset of experimentally or computationally curated MOFs originally appearing in the **QMOF database**.

These HSE06 values serve as **high-fidelity electronic structure labels** in this repository.
