### Predicting HSE06 Band Gaps with Graph Neural Networks and Feature-Engineered Models

This repository contains all code, workflows, and analysis scripts used in:

**“Data-Driven Electronic Structure Analysis of Metal-Organic Frameworks”**  
**Minhyuk Kang, Seung-Jae Shin, Tianshu Li, Aron Walsh**

This work investigates machine-learning approaches for accurate prediction of **HSE06 band gaps** in ~15,000 MOFs, focusing especially on the **low-band-gap regime (Eg < 1.5 eV)** that governs conductivity-related applications. The repository includes:

- Modified **CGCNN** with physics-informed atomic embeddings (partial atomic charges, electronic configuration features, GS properties).
- Full **XGBoost baseline pipeline**, including feature extraction, feature selection, and SHAP interpretability.
- Utilities for dataset reconstruction, preprocessing, graph construction, model training, and evaluation.
- Scripts for generating figures and reproducing results presented in poster/manuscript form.

## Overview

Accurate prediction of **low-band-gap MOFs** remains a difficult challenge for both traditional ML models and existing graph neural networks. Our findings highlight:

- Classical descriptors (RDF peaks, ordering parameters, pore metrics) help identify structural signatures of near-conductive MOFs.
- Baseline ML models (RF, SVR, LASSO, XGBoost) achieve good global accuracy but **fail systematically for Eg < 1.5 eV**.
- Standard CGCNN also overpredicts in this regime due to insufficient long-range electronic information.
- Introducing **partial charge embeddings** (PACMAN-predicted charges) significantly improves prediction—particularly for low-band-gap MOFs.
- Case studies of **Zn-based MOFs** demonstrate structural categories (Zn–O bridges, clusters, single-metal units) where model performance differs due to charge-transport topology.

# Case Study: Zn-based MOFs

Using 165 Zn-based MOF structures
- Zn-O bridging networks: most predictable (delocalized paths)
- Metal clusters: intermediate difficulty
- Single-metal-centered MOFs: largest errors (localized electrons)
